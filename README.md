# Building a Calendar App

The following describes the approach I would take if tasked with building a Full-Stack calendar app:

## Frontend

### Components Hierarchy

1. **App Component**
   - The top-level component that manages the overall structure of the app.
   - Renders the navigation bar and routes to various calendar views.
2. **Navigation Bar Component**
   - Displays the app's logo and navigation links.
   - Provides links to switch between different calendar views (e.g., day, week, month).
3. **Calendar View Component**

   - Depending on the selected view, this component renders the appropriate calendar view.

   a. **Day View Component** - Displays a single day's events and allows users to add or edit events.

   b. **Week View Component** - Displays a week's events in a grid format.

   c. **Month View Component** - Displays a month's events in a calendar format.

4. **Event Component**
   - Represents a single event in the calendar.
   - Displays event details and allows for editing or deletion.
5. **Event Form Component**
   - Provides a form for users to add or edit events.

### Frontend Functionality

1. **Navigation:**
   - Users can navigate between different calendar views using the navigation bar.
2. **Viewing Events:**
   - Users can view events in day, week, or month view.
   - Events are color-coded for clarity.
3. **Adding and Editing Events:**
   - Users can create new events or edit existing ones using the event form.
4. **Deleting Events:**
   - Users can delete events from within the event component.

## Backend

### Backend Framework

I would choose a backend framework like (e.g., Node.js with Express or Django) for building the server.

### Database

Choose a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB) to store event data.

### Backend Functionality

1. **API Routes:**
   - Create RESTful API endpoints to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for events.
2. **Authentication:**
   - Implement user authentication and authorization for securing data.
3. **Event Management:**
   - Handle requests to create, read, update, and delete events.
4. **Data Validation:**
   - Validate data sent from the frontend to ensure it meets the schema requirements.

## Data Schema

Define the data schema for the calendar app:

- **User**
  - `id` (Auto-generated)
  - `username`
  - `password` (hashed)
- **Event**
  - `id` (Auto-generated)
  - `userId` (Foreign key to User)
  - `title`
  - `description`
  - `startDateTime`
  - `endDateTime`
  - `location`
  - `color`

## Routes

### Authentication Routes

- `/api/auth/register`: Register a new user.
- `/api/auth/login`: Log in an existing user.
- `/api/auth/logout`: Log out the current user.

### Event Routes

- `/api/events`: Get a list of all events for the authenticated user (GET).
- `/api/events/:eventId`: Get details of a specific event (GET).
- `/api/events`: Create a new event (POST).
- `/api/events/:eventId`: Update an event (PUT).
- `/api/events/:eventId`: Delete an event (DELETE).
